# 1. Your first React components

## Instructions

1. In `index.js` you will find a variable called `text` with a value of "React is cool".

2. Create a **class-based component** called `ClassComponent` which renders a `<h1>` element with `text` as its content. Now create an **element** based on your component, and render it in `index.html`.

3. Comment out the component you created in Part 2. 

4. In a new line, create a **functional component** called `FunctionalComponent` which renders a `<h3>` element with `text` as its content. Now create an **element** based on your component, and render it in `index.html`.
