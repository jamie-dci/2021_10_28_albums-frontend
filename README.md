# React Practice SPA

Create a practice React app on a theme of your choice. 

Your theme could be, for example, a personal page advertising your skills, or a page about one of your areas of interest.

The main goal of this exercise is to let you practice some more with React, and to make use of the skills we have covered over the last couple of weeks. :-)

## Goals

First, you should take approximately 15 minutes to create a wireframe for your site. This can be as basic as you like, but will help you decide on a layout for your UI, and which parts of the UI should be made into separate components. It will also help you to plan the relationships between different parent/child components before you start coding.

While creating your app, you should try to use as many of the following skills as you can:

1. Using React **components** to render different parts of your UI
2. Using **props** to pass data down from parent to child components
3. Using the array method **.map()** to render a **list**, possibly of child components.
4. Using **state** where needed (e.g. in your "App" component) to manage data in your app.
    >- In a functional component, you can use "useState" **hooks** to create state.
    >- **Remember:** State should always be **"the single source of truth** for any data you are keeping track of in your app!
5. Using **event handlers** (e.g. "onClick" or "onChange") to respond to what the user does when they interact with your app.
6. Creating a **form** (e.g. a signup form for a newsletter, or an expression of interest form), if possible with some error handling.

**Hint:** If you are having trouble thinking of a theme for your app, or ways to use React in your app, you can always look back at the exercises we have done in the last few weeks (e.g. the "To Do" app, and others). These could give you some ideas about functionality you could implement. :-)
